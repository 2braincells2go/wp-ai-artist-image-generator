            <strong>This plugin was created by me, <a href="https://www.pierrevieville.fr" title="Visit website" target="_blank">Pierre Viéville</a>.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been a freelance developer for 10 years. 
            <strong><?php echo $this->plugin_full_name; ?></strong> is my first Wordpress plugin. I want to help the Wordpress community to improve the creativity of their content. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That's why I made a plugin allowing you to generate <u>royalty-free images</u> that you can use anywhere on your site: media library, blog posts, pages, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope this plugin will be useful to you in the creation of your new content. If you have any question about this one, feel free to check out my web links.

            How is it working ?
        </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>This plugin is an integration of OpenAI API with the new AI system <a target="_blank" title="Visit DALL·E 2" href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL·E 2</a></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            DALL·E 2 can create original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles. 
            This AI has learned the relationship between images and the text used to describe them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically the user input some text describing the images he wants. 1-10 images are generated. 
            Then the user can select some images and add them to the Wordpress medias library, ready to use 
            for a page or a post blog.
        </p>
        <p>
            The images generated are licenced free for any kind of usage. That are YOUR creations.
