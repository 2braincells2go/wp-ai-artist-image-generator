== Description ==

Artist Image Generator is an artificial intelligence image generation Wordpress plugin based on OpenAI DALL·E. The plugin allows you not only **create images**, but also **make variations of existing images** or **modifications (pro)** in order to create unique and royalty-free images.

**The plugin can be used directly from the Wordpress Popup Media Manager. It is compatible with the most popular block builders such as Gutenberg, Elementor, Beaver Builder, WP Bakery. And also Woocommerce compatible too.**

It also offers a shortcode system that allows you to place a **publicly accessible topic image generation tool on any page**. Your visitors can thus generate, via a form, a series of images of their choice according to a topic and options that you have predefined (eg: tattoos, professions, etc.)

Finally, if you're looking for an easy way for your Wordpress users to **generate custom avatars**, the shortcode feature also allows to generate and set their Wordpress profile photo. This feature is a nice **alternative to Gravatar, WP Avatar and native Wordpress system**. Particularly if you want to harmonize your authors' avatars according to topics.
